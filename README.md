### 🏠🔍📍 Understanding Addresses 🏠🔍📍

When working with binaries, understanding different types of addresses is crucial. Let's go over some key concepts:

1. **Base Virtual Address (🏠)**: This is the starting point of your binary in memory. Each time a binary is run, it's given this base address, which can change due to ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization). Typical base addresses are `0x00400000` for 32-bit binaries on Windows, `0x140000000` for 64-bit binaries on Windows, and `0x100000000` for 64-bit binaries on macOS.

2. **Base File Offset (📄🔍)**: The base file offset is the roadmap from the start of the binary file to the beginning of the code or data section. This offset is static, determined by the binary file itself, not by the system it's run on.

3. **Instruction Virtual Address (🏠➕📄🔍=📍)**: The instruction virtual address is the exact location of an instruction in memory when the binary is loaded. It's calculated as the base virtual address plus the base file offset.

These concepts are central to binary analysis, reverse engineering, and exploit development, helping you navigate through the complex city of memory! 🧭🗺️

Happy Patching! 💻🎯🚀
