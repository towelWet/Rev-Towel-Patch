## Dependencies 

1. **pefile:** `pip install pefile`
2. **lief:** `pip install lief`
3. **capstone:** `pip install capstone`
4. **keystone-engine:** `pip install keystone-engine`
5. **difflib:** `pip install difflib`
6. **obfuscation_detection:** `pip install obfuscation_detection`

You may have to installe radare2:
curl -Ls https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/releases/download/5.9.4/radare2-5.9.4.tar.xz | tar xJv
radare2-5.9.4/sys/install.sh


Note: If you are installing these packages in a production environment or you want to avoid conflicts with other packages, it might be a good idea to create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) first.

Also, you might need sudo access or add `--user` if you have permission issues while installing, like this: `pip install --user pefile`.
